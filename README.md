Front-End Portfolio

I am a junior self-taught front-end developer. I am based in Birmingham, UK. This portfolio consists of 3 small projects I have created. 

1. *Portfolio Landing Page*  ~    This was built using HTML, CSS

2. *Pro Photos*  ~                This is a mock website built using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP 4, Javascript

3. *Quiz* ~                       This is a 10 question quiz built using HTML, CSS, Javascript

(The 'Home' button in both projects takes you back to the 'Portfolio Landing Page'. 
Don't forget to watch the video in 'See What We Do' section of 'Pro Photos'.)
